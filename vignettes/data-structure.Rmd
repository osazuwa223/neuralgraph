## Inherits from the igraph class
Signalgraph inherits from the igraph class, and all igraph methods work on a signalgraph object.

## Building a signalgraph
Start with an input graph and data.  The variables in the data must match vertices in the graph.  However some vertices may have no data - i.e. they are hidden variables.

Here, I simulate a graph and dataset.  The graph has 10 nodes, 5 of which are observed in the data.  The data has 10 observations.

```{r, message=FALSE}
library(signalgraph)
```

```{r}
g <- random_unfit_sg(10, 5, 10)
sg_viz(g, show_biases = FALSE)
```

The green nodes are observed and the blue nodes are hidden in the data.

```{r}
data <- recover_design(g)
head(data)
```
