\title{Closure for generating a penalized least squares loss function for use in optimization}
\usage{
getObjective(initial_graph, v)
}
\arguments{
\item{initial_graph}{an initialized signal graph, the prefix 'initial' in 'initial_graph' is in contrast to 
candidate graphs against which the initial_graph will be compared in the optimization.}

\item{v}{the vertex whose weights will be optimized.}
}
\description{
This function is a closure that creates a loss function that takes a weight vector as an argument.
It produces a function that is passed to closure that generates the optimization function -- this optimization
function takes initial weight value and produces an optimized weight value.
The closure takes a graph vertex as an argument.  The algorithm identifies the incoming edges to the vertex,
then pulls the weights from those edges, constructing a weight vector.  This weight vector is the argument
for the loss function, and is used as the starting values in the optimization. The function calculates squared
error loss by first taking this weight vector input and predicting the outcome variable, then calculating loss
from the predicted and observed values.
