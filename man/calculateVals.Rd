\title{Calculate the Values of Vertices in Neural Network Model}
\usage{
calculateVals(g, v.index)
}
\arguments{
\item{g,}{the graph model}

\item{v.index,}{the index of a vertex}
}
\value{
an updated graph model
}
\description{
For a given vertex, the values for the vertex attribute 'input.signal' are calculated as the linear
combination of outputs with edge weights as weights. 'output.signal' is calculated by applying the activation
function to the input signal.
